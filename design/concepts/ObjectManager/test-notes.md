# Summary of tests for ObjectManager concept

## Test coverage

1. Principle test: "User assigns names and descriptions to objects, then modifies them"

+ Creates assigned objects
+ Accesses objects by title
+ Changes title
+ Changes description
+ Verifies object binding remains unchanged

2. Variant tests

+ createAssignedObject enforces invariants — no duplicate objects globally
+ createAssignedObject enforces invariants — no duplicate titles per user
+ deleteAssignedObject and lifecycle — delete, access, recreate
+ changeAssignedObjectTitle with validation — valid changes and error cases
+ suggestTitle async behavior — suggestion without objects and with objects
+ changeAssignedObjectDescription — update description and error handling

All actions are covered, error cases are validated, and all tests pass with no memory leaks.
