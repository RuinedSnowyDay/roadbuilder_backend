# Provide an implementation of ObjectManager concept considering the background on concept specification, but for now start just with specifications, interface, and simple template implementation to satisfy the compiler.

# response:

Here's the specification and a template implementation for the `ObjectManager` concept, following the guidelines provided.

First, we'll define the mock utility types and functions to ensure the TypeScript code is self-contained and compilable for demonstration. In a real project, these would be imported from `@utils/types.ts` and `@utils/database.ts`.

```typescript
// --- Mock Utility Types and Functions (for demonstration purposes) ---
// In a real project, these would be imported from @utils/types.ts and @utils/database.ts

/**
 * ID type for generic object identifiers.
 * This uses type branding to distinguish it from a regular string.
 */
export type ID = string & { __brand: "ID" };

/**
 * Empty type for actions that don't return specific data, only successful completion.
 */
export type Empty = Record<PropertyKey, never>;

// A simple counter-based freshID generator for demonstration.
// In a real database utility, this would generate unique, persistent IDs.
let _idCounter = 0;
export const freshID = (): ID => `obj:${_idCounter++}` as ID;

// Mock MongoDB types for compilation without actual npm install
export declare class Db {
  collection<T extends { _id: ID }>(name: string): Collection<T>;
}
export declare class Collection<T extends { _id: ID }> {
  insertOne(doc: T): Promise<any>;
  deleteOne(filter: Partial<T>): Promise<any>;
  countDocuments(filter: Partial<T>, options?: { limit?: number }): Promise<number>;
  findOne(filter: Partial<T>): Promise<T | null>;
}
// --- End Mock Utility Types and Functions ---

```

# Concept: ObjectManager

This concept is designed to manage the fundamental lifecycle of generic objects, focusing solely on their existence and identity. Other concepts would then add specific properties or behaviors to these objects using their own state and actions.

## concept: ObjectManager [Object]

**purpose** manage the lifecycle of generic, identity-only objects, allowing their creation and deletion.

**principle** If an object is created, it can be identified by its unique identifier. If it is subsequently deleted, it can no longer be identified or exist within this concept.

**state**
  a set of Objects

**actions**
  create (): (object: Object)
    **requires** true
    **effects** A new `Object` is generated and added to the set of Objects; the `object` result is this new Object's identifier.

  delete (object: Object): Empty
    **requires** `object` is in the set of Objects
    **effects** `object` is removed from the set of Objects. If `object` did not exist, no state change occurs, but an error may be returned if not found.

**queries**
  _exists (object: Object): (exists: Boolean)
    **effects** Returns true if `object` is in the set of Objects, false otherwise.
