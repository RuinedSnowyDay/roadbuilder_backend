# Summary of tests for ObjectManager concept

## Test coverage

1. Principle test: "User assigns names and descriptions to objects, then modifies them"

* Creates assigned objects
* Accesses objects by title
* Changes title
* Changes description
* Verifies object binding remains unchanged

2. Variant tests

* createAssignedObject enforces invariants — no duplicate objects globally
* createAssignedObject enforces invariants — no duplicate titles per user
* deleteAssignedObject and lifecycle — delete, access, recreate
* changeAssignedObjectTitle with validation — valid changes and error cases
* suggestTitle async behavior — suggestion without objects and with objects
* changeAssignedObjectDescription — update description and error handling

All actions are covered, error cases are validated, and all tests pass with no memory leaks.
