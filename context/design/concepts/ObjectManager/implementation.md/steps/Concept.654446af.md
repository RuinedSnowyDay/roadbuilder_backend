# Concept: ObjectManager

This concept is designed to manage the fundamental lifecycle of generic objects, focusing solely on their existence and identity. Other concepts would then add specific properties or behaviors to these objects using their own state and actions.

## concept: ObjectManager \[Object]

**purpose** manage the lifecycle of generic, identity-only objects, allowing their creation and deletion.

**principle** If an object is created, it can be identified by its unique identifier. If it is subsequently deleted, it can no longer be identified or exist within this concept.

**state**
  a set of Objects

**actions**
  create (): (object: Object)
    **requires** true
    **effects** A new `Object` is generated and added to the set of Objects; the `object` result is this new Object's identifier.

  delete (object: Object): Empty
    **requires** `object` is in the set of Objects
    **effects** `object` is removed from the set of Objects. If `object` did not exist, no state change occurs, but an error may be returned if not found.

**queries**
  \_exists (object: Object): (exists: Boolean)
    **effects** Returns true if `object` is in the set of Objects, false otherwise.
