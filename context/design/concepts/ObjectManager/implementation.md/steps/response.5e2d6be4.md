# response:

Here's the specification and a template implementation for the `ObjectManager` concept, following the guidelines provided.

First, we'll define the mock utility types and functions to ensure the TypeScript code is self-contained and compilable for demonstration. In a real project, these would be imported from `@utils/types.ts` and `@utils/database.ts`.

```typescript
// --- Mock Utility Types and Functions (for demonstration purposes) ---
// In a real project, these would be imported from @utils/types.ts and @utils/database.ts

/**
 * ID type for generic object identifiers.
 * This uses type branding to distinguish it from a regular string.
 */
export type ID = string & { __brand: "ID" };

/**
 * Empty type for actions that don't return specific data, only successful completion.
 */
export type Empty = Record<PropertyKey, never>;

// A simple counter-based freshID generator for demonstration.
// In a real database utility, this would generate unique, persistent IDs.
let _idCounter = 0;
export const freshID = (): ID => `obj:${_idCounter++}` as ID;

// Mock MongoDB types for compilation without actual npm install
export declare class Db {
  collection<T extends { _id: ID }>(name: string): Collection<T>;
}
export declare class Collection<T extends { _id: ID }> {
  insertOne(doc: T): Promise<any>;
  deleteOne(filter: Partial<T>): Promise<any>;
  countDocuments(filter: Partial<T>, options?: { limit?: number }): Promise<number>;
  findOne(filter: Partial<T>): Promise<T | null>;
}
// --- End Mock Utility Types and Functions ---

```
