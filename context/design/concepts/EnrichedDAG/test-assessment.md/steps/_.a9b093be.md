# Summary of tests for EnrichedDAG concept

## Test coverage

1. Principle test: "User assigns names and descriptions to objects, then modifies them"

* Creates a graph and nodes with titles and enrichments
* Adds edges (acyclic)
* Changes a node title
* Verifies title update

2. Variant tests

* addEdge prevents cycle creation: flow A→B→C; blocks C→A and self-loops
* node and edge removal: removes edges, deletes nodes, cascades removal
* deleteGraph removes all associated nodes and edges: multiple graphs; deletes one
  without affecting others
* addNode enforces unique titles within a graph: blocks duplicate titles; different
  graphs can reuse titles
* changeNodeTitle validates uniqueness: successful change, prevents conflict with
  existing titles
* accessEdge and edge queries: access by source/target; query outgoing/incoming

All actions are covered, error cases are validated, and all tests pass with no memory
leaks.

## Interesting moments

* Interestingly, the generated prompt for the `suggestEdge` incorporates the list of
  edges in the graph in the prompt. However, `suggestNodeTitle` does not, only the
  number of edges and the existing node titles.
