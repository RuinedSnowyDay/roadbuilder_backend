# Testing Cycle Detection in Edge Addition

## 1. Create graph and add nodes

✓ Created graph: `019a2e07-b998-7da7-817d-d1c432a556db`
✓ Created 3 nodes

## 2. Create a path: A → B → C

✓ Created edges: A → B → C

## 3. Add a valid edge (A → C, no cycle)

✓ Added edge A → C (valid, no cycle)

## 4. Try to create a cycle (C → A)

✗ Failed as expected: Adding this edge would create a cycle in the graph

## 5. Try to create a self-loop (A → A)

✗ Failed as expected: Adding this edge would create a cycle in the graph
\----- output end -----
Action: addEdge prevents cycle creation ... ok (1s)
Action: node and edge removal ...
